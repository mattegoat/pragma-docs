:::success Testnet is live

The Pragma v2 testnet is now live. You can find more information [here](/v2/Price%20Feeds/How%20to/evm-integration)

:::

The v2 builds upon the principles of v1 while offering enhanced capabilities.

## Available Anywhere, Anytime

Thanks to [Hyperlane](https://hyperlane.xyz), v2 is accessible on any blockchain. We prioritize customer needs over chain specifics, following you wherever you go. With Pragma v2, you can schedule any feed, at any time, on any execution environment. Additionally, you can integrate with various MEV blockers to reclaim a portion of the fees your protocol generates through MEV.

## Modular

V2 is modular from top to bottom, allowing easy customization of every stack component to suit your protocol's needs. You can build any feed, secure the oracle with your protocol's token, modify data providers and sources, construct private input aggregation, and much more. It's limitless infrastructure for limitless new horizons.

## Maximally Secure

Like you, we're tired of SLA-based oracles that offer no guarantees or economic security. We're developing v2 to minimize the trust cost associated with using oracles, and we won't stop until we have the best solution. To achieve this, we're adopting a modular approach and leveraging [Symbiotic](https://symbiotic.fi) to provide you with the right tools for building secure and efficient dapps.
