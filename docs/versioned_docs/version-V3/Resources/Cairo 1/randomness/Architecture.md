Pragma offers a verifiable randomness feed that allows protocols to request secure randomness on-chain.
This feed is being rolled out in two phases: In the first phase (currently live) the randomness proof is posted as calldata, allowing anyone to verify it off-chain. See below for more details on how to verify the randomness.

In the second phase, the proof will be verified directly on-chain (coming soon) and requesters will be required to cover gas costs of their callback function plus a small fee to cover the cost of generating randomness.

## Sample Code

If you are just trying to get started with using randomness, see the self-contained code snippet. If you'd like to use more advanced oracle functions, read on past the code block for further information. You can find a full sample randomness receiver contract [here](https://github.com/astraly-labs/pragma-oracle/blob/main/src/randomness/example_randomness.cairo).

```rust
#[starknet::contract]
mod ExampleRandomness {
    use super::{ContractAddress, IExampleRandomness};
    use starknet::info::{get_block_number, get_caller_address, get_contract_address};
    use pragma::randomness::randomness::{IRandomnessDispatcher, IRandomnessDispatcherTrait};
    use array::{ArrayTrait, SpanTrait};
    use traits::{TryInto, Into};
    #[storage]
    struct Storage {
        randomness_contract_address: ContractAddress,
        min_block_number_storage: u64,
        last_random_storage: felt252,
    }

    #[constructor]
    fn constructor(ref self: ContractState, randomness_contract_address: ContractAddress) {
        self.randomness_contract_address.write(randomness_contract_address);
    }

    #[external(v0)]
    impl IExampleRandomnessImpl of IExampleRandomness<ContractState> {
        fn get_last_random(self: @ContractState) -> felt252 {
            let last_random = self.last_random_storage.read();
            return last_random;
        }

        fn request_my_randomness(
            ref self: ContractState,
            seed: u64,
            callback_address: ContractAddress,
            callback_gas_limit: u64,
            publish_delay: u64,
            num_words: u64
        ) {
            let randomness_contract_address = self.randomness_contract_address.read();
            let randomness_dispatcher = IRandomnessDispatcher {
                contract_address: randomness_contract_address
            };
            let request_id = randomness_dispatcher
                .request_random(
                    seed, callback_address, callback_gas_limit, publish_delay, num_words
                );

            let current_block_number = get_block_number();
            self.min_block_number_storage.write(current_block_number + publish_delay);

            return ();
        }


        fn receive_random_words(
            ref self: ContractState,
            requestor_address: ContractAddress,
            request_id: u64,
            random_words: Span<felt252>
        ) {
            // Have to make sure that the caller is the Pragma Randomness Oracle contract
            let caller_address = get_caller_address();
            assert(
                caller_address == self.randomness_contract_address.read(),
                'caller not randomness contract'
            );
            // and that the current block is within publish_delay of the request block
            let current_block_number = get_block_number();
            let min_block_number = self.min_block_number_storage.read();
            assert(min_block_number <= current_block_number, 'block number issue');

            // and that the requestor_address is what we expect it to be (can be self
            // or another contract address), checking for self in this case
            //let contract_address = get_contract_address();
            //assert(requestor_address == contract_address, 'requestor is not self');

            // Optionally: Can also make sure that request_id is what you expect it to be,
            // and that random_words_len==num_words

            // Your code using randomness!
            let random_word = *random_words.at(0);

            self.last_random_storage.write(random_word);

            return ();
        }
    }
```

## How Randomness is Generated

Pragma's randomness is based off of the [Internet Engineering Task Force's (IETF) Verifiable Random Function using elliptic curves](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-vrf-06). Their Python implementation is available as [open source code](https://github.com/nccgroup/draft-irtf-cfrg-vrf-06/blob/master/README.md).

When smart contracts request randomness, they specify a random seed. This seed uniquely determines the randomness, so the Pragma as the VRF provider is not able to manipulate the randomness. However calculating the randomness requires having access to a private key that is not known, so the smart contract (and any other party observing the randomness request) is not able to predict the randomness. Off-chain, the randomness is calculated using the private key and the seed. That randomness and the proof are then sent on-chain, where the unbiased randomness is then available to the smart contract that requested it.

Pragma Network's verifiable random function (VRF) over a specific elliptic curve, named Curve25519. Most known blockchain implementations of a VRF are using the so-called "Bitcoin curve", or secpk256k1. We chose this algorithm because it is more secure than other commonly used ones (that possibly have backdoors - see [here](https://blog.cloudflare.com/a-relatively-easy-to-understand-primer-on-elliptic-curve-cryptography/#thedownside) and [here](https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2013/09/18/the-many-flaws-of-dualecdrbg/)). We chose this curve in particular for two reasons:

- Building the tools to perform arithmetic operations on Curve25519 is a premiere for programmable blockchains and theoretically enables compatibility with [all the protocols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve25519#Protocols) that use Curve25519 for digital signatures, such as IPFS, Ripple, Monero, Signal, Protonmail, and many others. This is a great step towards interoperability with StarkNet and it is only possible by leveraging its computational capabilities.

- One key part of the VRF algorithm implies taking a public input and converting it to an elliptic curve point. This process is called "hashing to the curve", and the standard way of doing it for Curve25519 is using [Elligator2](https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/325). In Cairo, part of the Elligator algorithm can be computed quickly and safely using a hint and allows cheaper verification costs than hashing to the secpk256k1 curve.

## Verifying The Randomness

As mentioned above, in the first phase of Pragma Network's VRF feed, the randomness proof is posted as calldata, allowing anyone to verify it off-chain.

In order to make it easier to verify that a specific piece of randomness was verifiable, we provide an open source implementation of the verifier. Follow these simple steps to verify any randomness provided by Pragma Network:

1. Install the Pragma Python package `pip install pragma-sdk`
2. Run `python3 -m pragma-sdl.cli random verify-random <TRANSACTION\*HASH>` where `TRANSACTION_HASH` is the hash of the StarkNet testnet transaction in which the randomness was submitted to your smart contract.

## Technical Specification

### Function: `request_random`

Allows your smart contract to request randomness. Upon calling the Pragma contract, an event is emitted triggering the randomness and proof to be generated off-chain and then submitted back on-chain, calling the callback function `receive_random_words` on your contract.

#### Inputs

- `seed`: random seed that feeds into the verifiable random algorithm, must be different every time. 
- `callback_address`: address to call `receive_random_words` on with the randomness
- `callback_gas_limit`: gas limit on the callback function
- `publish_delay`: minimum number of blocks to wait from the request to fulfillment
- `num_words`: number of random words to receive in one call. Each word is a felt252.

#### Returns

- `request_id`: ID of the request, which can be used to check the status, cancel the request and check that the callback function was correctly called.

### Callback Function: `receive_random_words`

This is function must be defined on the contract at `callback_address` initially passed in the randomness request.

#### Inputs

- `requestor_address`: address that submitted the randomness request
- `request_id`: id of the randomness request (auto-incrementing for each `requestor_address`)
- `random_words`: an span of random words

### Function: `cancel_random_request`

Allows the requestor of randomness to cancel the request.

#### Inputs

- `request_id`: ID of the request to be canceled
- `seed`: seed used to request the randomness
- `requestor_address`: address of the contract that originally requested the randomness. Currently must be the same as the contract calling the cancel function
- `minimum_block_number`: the block number in which the randomness could first have been published, equal to `publish_delay` + `block_number` of the request
- `callback_address`: argument provided in the randomness request
- `callback_gas_limit`: argument provided in the randomness request
- `num_words`: argument provided in the randomness request

### Function: `get_request_status`

Get the status of a randomness request.

#### Inputs

- `requestor_address`: address of the requesting contract
- `request_id`: ID of the request to be canceled

#### Returns

- `status_`: status of the request, see [here](https://github.com/astraly-labs/pragma-oracle/blob/main/src/randomness/randomness.cairo).
There are four defined status: 
  0=UNINITIALIZED, 1=RECEIVED, 2=FULFILLED, 3=CANCELLED
