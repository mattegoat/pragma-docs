## Technical Specification

### Function: `get_data_median`

This is the the simplest function that will aggregate all data into a median for a given data type.

#### Inputs

- `data_type`: enum of the data type you are requesting (See DataType structure). By providing the enum data type, you also provide the pair id (for spot entries), or the pair id and the expiration timestamp (for futures).

#### Returns

This function returns a struct, PragmaPricesResponse, which contains the following fields:

- `price`: aggregation result of all entries for the given key based on the robust median algorithm. Multiplied by `10**decimals`
- `decimals`: number of places that value has been shifted to allow for greater accuracy
- `last_updated_timestamp`: timestamp of the most recent entry aggregated
- `num_sources_aggregated`: number of sources aggregated in the final answer. Use this to check if one of the sources you requested was not available, or if there are enough data reports for you to rely on the answer
- `expiration_timestamp` : timestamp of when the data will expire. Works only for futures.

### Function : `get_data_median_for_sources`

This is the simplest function that will aggregate all data for given sources into a median for a given data type.

#### Inputs

- `data_type`: enum of the data type you are requesting (See DataType structure). By providing the enum data type, you also provide the pair id (for spot entries), or the pair id and the expiration timestamp (for futures).
- `sources`: array of sources to aggregate. Requires a Span of felt252.

#### Returns

This function returns a struct, PragmaPricesResponse, which contains the following fields:

- `price`: aggregation result of all entries for the given key based on the robust median algorithm. Multiplied by `10**decimals`
- `decimals`: number of places that value has been shifted to allow for greater accuracy
- `last_updated_timestamp`: timestamp of the most recent entry aggregated
- `num_sources_aggregated`: number of sources aggregated in the final answer. Use this to check if one of the sources you requested was not available, or if there are enough data reports for you to rely on the answer
- `expiration_timestamp` : timestamp of when the data will expire. Works only for futures.

#### Function: `get_data`

Similar to get_data_median except it allows for an additional parameter to specify a custom aggregated logic (median, mean and more).

#### Inputs

- `data_type`: enum of the data type you are requesting (See DataType structure). By providing the enum data type, you also provide the pair id (for spot entries), or the pair id and the expiration timestamp (for futures).
- `aggregation_mode`: aggregation mode to use for combining the many data sources available in Pragma. Use the structure AggregationMode defined in Pragma. Option must currently be set to `MEDIAN` or `MEAN`, . Additional options `VWAP`, `EXPONENTIAL_DECAY` are coming soon.

#### Returns

- `price`: aggregation result of all entries for the given key based on the robust median algorithm. Multiplied by `10**decimals`
- `decimals`: number of places that value has been shifted to allow for greater accuracy (fixed point)
- `last_updated_timestamp`: timestamp of the most recent entry aggregated
- `num_sources_aggregated`: number of sources aggregated in the final answer. Use this to check if one of the sources you requested was not available, or if there are enough data reports for you to rely on the answer
- `expiration_timestamp` : timestamp of when the data will expire. Works only for futures.

### Function: `get_data_with_USD_hop`

This function enables you to rebase the price, i.e. use a different base currency. For instance, if you want the price of BTC/ETH, you can combine the BTC/USD and ETH/USD price data to derive that.

- `quote_currency_id`: felt252 for the base currency (e.g. ETH)
- `aggregation_mode`: aggregation mode to use for combining the many data sources available in Pragma. Use constants defined in Pragma. Option must currently be set to `MEDIAN`, `MEAN`. Additional options `TWAP`, `EXPONENTIAL_DECAY` are coming soon.
- `typeof` : SimpleDataType, represents an enum of the data type you are requesting. No pair_id /expiration timestamp required on the enum.
- `expiration_timestamp`: expiration timestamp of the data you are requesting. Only required for futures.

#### Returns

- `price`: aggregation result of all entries for the given key (using the algorithm specified by the `aggregation_mode` parameter). Multiplied by `10**decimals`
- `decimals`: number of places that value has been shifted to allow for greater accuracy (fixed point)
- `last_updated_timestamp`: timestamp of the most recent entry aggregated
- `num_sources_aggregated`: number of sources aggregated in the final answer. Use this to check if one of the sources you requested was not available, or if there are enough data reports for you to rely on the answer
- `expiration_timestamp` : timestamp of when the data will expire. Works only for futures.

### Function: `get_data_for_sources`

This function enables you to get the price of one currency in terms of another, by specifying the path from one the quote to the base currency. For instance, if you want the price of ETH/EUR, you can combine the ETH/USD, BTC/USD and BTC/EUR price data to derive that.

#### Inputs

- `decimals`: number of places that value has been shifted to allow for greater accuracy (fixed point)
- `last_updated_timestamp`: timestamp of the most recent entry aggregated
- `num_sources_aggregated`: number of sources aggregated in the final answer. Use this to check if one of the sources you requested was not available, or if there are enough data reports for you to rely on the answer
- `expiration_timestamp` : timestamp of when the data will expire. Works only for futures.
